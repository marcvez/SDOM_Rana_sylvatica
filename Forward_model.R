# In this model we will use the values obtained in the backward simulation to 
# simulate a tadpole population trying to achieve maximum fitness at the end of 
# the metamorphosis period. At each time step, the organism either lives or dies. 
# If it lives, it finds food (size and/or performance can influence how much 
# food it finds) and this is spent on growing or moving faster.

# This matrix is going to store the state of each tadpole during the whole
# period. It is going to be read by the "Alive" matrix, to determine how many 
# individuals are still alive at each time step. The last columns store the Size,
