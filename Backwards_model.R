#---------------------Backwards model-----------------------

# In this model you either invest in either or you die, it's a simpler model. 
# To do this, we will use a matrix where the y-axis contains the different units 
# of energy invested in growth, and the x-axis contains the units of energy 
# invested in performance. The content of each cell will be the fitness value 
# of that combination of traits. 
# The function should see how fitness increases with respect to the previous 
# state by deciding whether to invest in growth (by moving down one cell 
# in the matrix) or in performance (by moving one cell to the right). It will then 
# calculate the fitness increase of the two decisions and choose the best option.
