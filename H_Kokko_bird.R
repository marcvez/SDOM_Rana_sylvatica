# STOCHASTIC DYNAMIC MODEL: A SMALL BIRD IN WINTER
# Here we try to link concepts from the Hanna Kokko model (HK model), 
# concepts from chapter five of Clark & Mangel (C&M model),
# and Thorbj√∏rn's code

library('plot.matrix')
library('ggplot2')
library('plot3D')

#---- State ---- 
# In the HK model, state was more or less a ranked order where 0=death
# and condition improved with increasing order. It was good for illustrative 
# purposes but not so biologically meaningful. 
# In the C&M model, we define both maximum (x_max) and minumum (m_0) values.
# An important difference between the two models is that in the C&M model,
# a bird with zero fat reserves can increase its state by foraging 
# first thing the next morning. Therefore, x=m_0 at the start of the day
# does not automatically result in death like it does in the HK model. 

m_0    <- 10    # Mass of bird with zero fat reserves (g)

x_max  <- 2.4   # Maximum fat reserves (g)
# Equivalent to maxc in HK model

x_d    <- seq(from = 0, to = x_max, 
              length.out=100)   # Discretized values of x
# In the HK model, we limited ourselves to whole numbers


#---- Actions ---- 
# In our HK model, a bird either forages or rests (# actions = 2)
# In the C&M model, a bird decides between three patches denoted by H[i] (# actions = 3)
# where i = [1, 2, 3] 
# Note: in the book they use 0, 1, 2 but using 1-3 makes subsetting more straightforward
# Each patch (H[i]) has a different risk of predation denoted by mu. 
# Each patch also has a different rate of foraging intake denoted by e, 
# which is similar to the foraging efficiency in the HK model. 

mu <- c(0, 0.001, 0.005)  # Basic daily predation risk per patch (/day) 

e  <- c(0, 0.6, 2.0)      # Net daily forage inntake for patch 1/2 (g/day)

# In both models, predation is a function of body mass.
# In the HK model we assumed a linear relationship when foraging, with 0 predation when resting. 
# In the C&M model, the increase in predation depends on the patch and energetic reserves,
# equal to mu[i]*exp(lambda*x) see p. 111. 

lambda <- 0.46     # Increase in predation risk with body mass (/g fat reserves)

# The metabolic costs during the day are also mass-dependent, equal to gamma * (m0 * x), 
# where m0 is the mass of the bird with zero fat reserves (defined above) p. 111. 
# In the HK model, recall that metabolic costs were held constant. 

gamma  <- 0.04     # Metabolic rate (g/day)
# Equivalent to c in HK model


#---- Fitness ---- 
# In the HK model, terminal fitness occurs at the end of the day. 
# In the C&M model, terminal fitness is defined as the probability of surviving the winter.
# Winter consists of 120 days (Days) and each day is divided into 50 time steps (Time). 
# We can account for this with a nested loop (see backwards iteration below). 
# Environmental stochasticity arises from overnight metabolic costs. 
# A bad night has a higher metabolic costs (c_b) and occurs with probability p_b
# A good night has a lower metabolic cost (c_g) and occurs with probability 1-p_b

Time <- 50    # Number of time periods per day (where time+1 is the beginning of nightime)
Days <- 20   # Number of days in winter (where days+1 is the start of spring)
c_g  <- 0.48  # Metabolic cost of a good night (g)
c_b  <- 1.20  # Metabolic cost of a bad night (g)
p_b  <- 0.167 # Probability of a bad night

# Recall that terminal fitness is the probability of surviving the winter (i.e. d+1)
# We can calculate it using equation 5.1 in C&M

# First, an empty array to hold fitness values from the loop
Fit<- array(data = NA, dim = c(length(x_d), Time+1, Days), 
            dimnames = list(x_d, 1:(Time+1), 1:(Days)) )

# Calculate terminal fitness F(x, t+1, d) where x=state 
for (j in 1:length(x_d)) {
  # Note: I use j as the index of an x-value in x_d and x 
  # as the value of x_d[j].
  x <- x_d[j]
  # If your state does not allow you to survive a good night,
  # survival is impossible and your fitness is zero. 
  if (x < c_g) {
    Fit[j, Time+1, Days] <- 0
    # If your state allows you to survive a good night, but not a bad one,
    # you survive with probability p_g=1-p_b (the probability of a good night). 
  } else if (x < c_b) {
    Fit[j, Time+1, Days] <- (1-p_b)
    # If your state allows you to survive a bad night, you will always survive
    # i.e. your probabiity of survival is 1. 
  } else {
    Fit[j, Time+1, Days] <- 1
  } # end if-else loop
} # end for loop

as.matrix(Fit[, Time+1, Days]) # Did it work? 
# The left column shows state, the right column shows the terminal fitness we just calculated. 
# To survive a good night requires 0.48 g of fat reserves.
# When x < 0.48 the bird dies (it cannot survive the best-case scenario). 
# To survive a bad night requires 1.2 g of fat reserves. 
# When 0.48 < x < 1.2 the probability of surivival =  1-p_b = 0.833
# When x > 1.2 (the cost of a bad night), the bird always survives (proability =1)

#---- Discrete state variable ----
# The computer discretizes the state variable 
# but in reality energeic reserves is a continuous variable. 
# We overcome this using interpolation (see C&M 2.1)

interpolate <- function (x, t, d) {
  
  # Returns the index of the closest discrete x value 
  closest_discrete_x <- function(x) {
    # Note: only the first value is returned if there are multiple 
    # equidistant values.
    return(which(abs(x_d - x) == min(abs(x_d - x)))[1])
  }
  
  # Interpolate between two values a and b. dx is a value between 0 and 1.
  linear_interpolation <- function (a, b, dx) {
    return((1-dx)*a+ b*dx)
  }
  
  # No point in doing interpolation if energy reserves are negative.
  # Bird is dead.
  if (x < 0) { return(0) }
  
  # Figure out between which two discretized values of x our x lies.
  closest <- closest_discrete_x(x)
  if (x < x_d[closest]) {
    j1 <- closest -1
    j2 <- closest
  } else if (x > x_d[closest]){
    j1 <- closest
    j2 <- closest +1
  } 
  # Fitness value for x is already present in the matrix. No need to interpolate.
  else { return( Fit[closest, t, d]) }
  
  # Calculate how x is positioned in relation to x_d[j1] and x_d[j2].
  # 0: Closer to x_d[j1]
  # 1: Closer to x_d[j2]
  delta_x <- (x-x_d[j1])/(x_d[j2]-x_d[j1])
  
  # Interpolate.
  return(linear_interpolation(Fit[j1, t, d], Fit[j2, t, d], delta_x))
}

# ---- Backwards Iteration ----
